# Introduction_to_Regression_with_Statsmodels_in_Python_DataCamp

## Jargon
### Response variable (a.k.a dependent variable)
The variable that you want to predict
### Explanatory variables (a.k.a. independent variables)
The variables that explain how the response variable will change.
## Linear regression 
The response variable is numeric.
## Logistic regression
The response variable is logical
## Simple linear/ logistic regression
There is only one explanatory variable.
## What is regression?
* Statistical models to explore the relationship a response variable and some explanatory variables
* Given values of explanatory variables, you can predict the values of response variable.

## Fitting a linear Regression
### Straight lines are defined by two things
#### Intercept
The y value at the point when x is zero
#### Slope
The amount the y value increases if you increase x by one
#### Equation 
y = intercept + slope * x
### Interpreting the model coefficients
#### Equation 
total_payment_sek = 19.99 + 3.41 * n_claims

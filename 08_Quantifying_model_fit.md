# Coefficient of Determination
Sometimes called "r-squared" or "R-squared"
 
The proportion of the variance in the response variable that is predictable from the explanatory variable

* ``1`` means a perfect fit
* ``0`` means the worst possible fit

# Residual Standard error (RSE)
* A "typical" difference between a prediction and an observed response
* It has the same unit as the response variable

# Interpreting RSE
``mdl_bream`` has an RSE of ``74`` 

The difference between predicted bream masses and observed breams masses is typically about 74g.
